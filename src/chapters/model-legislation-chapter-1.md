## Notes

[^1]:

      The terminology used in this provision to exclude certain types of operations and facilities from the definition of HOME COOKING OPERATION may need to be revised to match the names used in applicable state law for these types of operations/facilities.

[^2]:
     Regulations around cottage food and catering vary from state to state. Some states are choosing to consolidate the number of home-based business under 1 permit. Consider how these three different businesses work together.

[^3]:

     Replace "regulatory authority" with the term used in relevant state law for the agency(ies) that will be primarily responsible for inspections and permitting, which may be local health departments or a state department of health or agriculture.

[^4]:

     Replace "state agency" with the term used to refer to the state-level agency that will have overall responsibility for this program and will promulgate the governing regulations

[^5]:

     "A state may choose to limit the activities of the Home Cooking Operation through placing restrictions on the number of meals prepared or customers served per day, the number of meals prepared or customers served per week, or the amount of revenue made in a year. States should ensure that home cooks can make a living wage regardless of the cap put in place. One possible formula is: Livable wage for the state * 2 (because of the 50% margins in food) + $5,000 for overhead (permits, insurance, etc) = cap. States might also choose to limit the number of employees a Home Cooking Operation can have."
